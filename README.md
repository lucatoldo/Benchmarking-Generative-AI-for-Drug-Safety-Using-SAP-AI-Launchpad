# Benchmarking-Generative-AI-for-Drug-Safety-Using-SAP-AI-Launchpad
This repository contains the data described in the blog, as well as a PDF version of the blog to facilitate readout.
The intention of this repository is to facilitate quantitative evaluation of LLM using the SAP AI Launchpad.
The eval-data/ content as well as the e5b3edccc8762b0 contents are specific of SAP AI Launchpad.

# Input
## Intial input files from ade-v2
DRUG-AE.txt, DRUG-DOSE.txt and ADE-NEG.txt are the official files from the ADE-V2 dataset, as published by Gurulingappa et al.2012 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2012.04.008
They are available from https://huggingface.co/datasets/ade-benchmark-corpus/ade_corpus_v2

## Temporary excel sheet
DRUG-AE.xls is a manually created version of the ADE-V2 files, having the DRUG-AE tab containing both ADE-NEG.txt and DRUG-AE.txt, while DRUG-DOSE tab contains only the DRUG-DOSE.txt content.

This sheet is then used for generation of the eval-data/testdata/file

## Quick and dirty python to generate testdata
ConsolidateADE2-dataset.ipynb reads the DRUG-AE.xls and generates the JSON file used for the evaluations that is then manually moved to eval-data/testdata/ade-v2-300-dataset.json

## eval-data 
This is the folder that contains the input artifacts for the run as described in the blog.
THe whole eval-data is then need to be pushed to the AWS S3 bucket 
- runs
contains the run configuration files with the prompts
- testdata
contains the dataset generated by the python ade-v2-300-dataset.json

# Ouptput
## e5b3edcccc8762b0
This  folder stores all the outputs from the run described in the blog. 
- debug_files
  here are all the detailed logs, and the intermediate SQLite formatted results
- evaluation_result
  this folder contains the final output, results.db and as well the modified version obtained applying the various SQL statements as in the blog, using the DBBrowser for SQL (results.sqbpro)
## Deep analysis
All SQL used to do a deep analysis of the results.db is stored in the file "SQL for deep analysis.md"
The file missing_results.xslx has been generated with an SQL described in the file "SQL for deep analysis.md" and shows which phrases and corresponding reference golden truth were missing in the results.
